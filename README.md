Optical Character Recognition (OCR), a tool that lets you easily copy text from picture, scanned documents, printed books, etc. We can convert hardcopy document into editable digital document and avoid the retyping of a document.

You can simply capture a picture of the printed text with your mobile phone, use CamScanner App for impressive results and then upload a scanned image file. Once the OCR process is done, you will be able to copy-paste or edit the text content of that image.
